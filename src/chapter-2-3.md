The following are examples of successful implementation of AI in focus improvement:

1. Forest App: The Forest app uses gamification and machine learning to help users stay focused and avoid distractions. The app encourages users to plant a virtual tree, which grows as they stay focused. If the user leaves the app or navigates to a non-work-related website, the tree withers.

2. [Brain.fm](http://Brain.fm): [Brain.fm](http://Brain.fm) is an AI-powered music app that provides customized soundtracks for focus and productivity. The app uses machine learning algorithms to analyze an individual's brainwaves and provide tailored soundtracks that promote focus and concentration.

3. RescueTime: RescueTime is an AI-powered productivity app that tracks an individual's computer and mobile device usage to provide insights into how they spend their time. The app provides detailed reports on how much time is spent on productive activities versus distractions, along with suggestions for improving productivity.
